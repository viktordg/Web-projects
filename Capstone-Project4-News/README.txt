API Integration

Endpoint:
NewsAPI Endpoint to fetch top headlines: https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines
Usage:
The backend server uses Axios to make a GET request to the NewsAPI, fetching top headlines.
API data is sent to the frontend where it is dynamically displayed as clickable cards.

Routes
GET /: Serves the main HTML page.
GET /api/news: Backend route that fetches news from the NewsAPI and returns it as JSON to the frontend.

Frontend

HTML:
index.html serves as the main page that displays news cards.

CSS:
styles.css contains styles for the news cards and overall layout.

JavaScript:
script.js handles fetching news data from the /api/news route and dynamically populates the news cards on the webpage.
Future Enhancements
Responsive Design Improvements: Enhance the responsiveness of the news cards across various devices.
User Preferences: Allow users to select which news categories they prefer.
Caching Mechanism: Implement caching to reduce API calls and load times.

Issues and Resolutions
Common Issues:
API Rate Limits: NewsAPI free tier has a limit on the number of requests. Consider caching responses or upgrading to a paid plan if necessary.
Content Overflow: Some news cards may show overflow text depending on the content length; adjusting CSS for these scenarios can improve visual presentation.


5-minute News provides a streamlined, visually appealing platform for users to quickly access the day's top headlines. 
Future updates and community contributions can extend functionality, improving both user experience and performance.
